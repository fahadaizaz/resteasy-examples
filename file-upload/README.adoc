= File Upload

This is a simple example of using a Jakarta REST application to upload files using `multipart/form-data`.  It uses the
following Jakarta EE 10 API's:

* https://jakarta.ee/specifications/restful-ws/[Jakarta RESTful Web Services]
* https://jakarta.ee/specifications/cdi/[Jakarta Contexts Dependency Injection]

The client side is composed of HTML and JavaScript. It allows you to upload image files, text files and PDF's by
default. It then displays the uploaded files. The default location of the uploaded files is the server directory under
`file-uploads/${user.name}`. This can be overridden with the `upload.directory` system property.

== Building the application:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean verify
----

== Running the application in WildFly:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean wildfly:dev
----
